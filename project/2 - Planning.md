**Agile Project Plan for miniRT - RayTracing Program**

### **Sprint 1: Setup and Environment Configuration**
**Goals:**
- Set up the development environment, including the miniLibX library.
- Create a basic project structure and a Makefile for compilation.
- Implement basic error handling for the environment setup.

**Tasks:**
1. Research and install miniLibX.
2. Set up the project directory structure.
3. Create a basic Makefile for building the project.
4. Implement error handling for environment setup.

### **Sprint 2: Parsing Scene Description File**
**Goals:**
- Develop the functionality to parse the scene description file.
- Implement validation for correct scene file format.
- Handle errors gracefully during file parsing.

**Tasks:**
1. Design a parser for the scene description file.
2. Implement parsing logic for each type of scene element.
3. Add validation checks for the correct format of the scene file.
4. Handle errors during parsing and report them appropriately.

### **Sprint 3: Geometric Object Handling**
**Goals:**
- Implement handling for geometric objects (sphere, plane, cylinder).
- Ensure correct intersection calculations.
- Support resizing of objects.

**Tasks:**
1. Implement data structures for geometric objects.
2. Develop intersection calculation logic for each object.
3. Enable resizing functionality for objects.
4. Implement translation and rotation transformations.

### **Sprint 4: Lighting and Rendering**
**Goals:**
- Implement lighting management, including spot brightness and ambient/diffuse lighting.
- Develop rendering logic to display images in a window.
- Ensure smooth window management.

**Tasks:**
1. Implement lighting calculations for spot brightness and ambient/diffuse lighting.
2. Develop rendering logic using miniLibX.
3. Implement smooth window management features.
4. Integrate rendering with object handling.

### **Sprint 5: User Interface and Interaction**
**Goals:**
- Implement user interface features for a seamless user experience.
- Ensure adherence to standard conventions for interaction.
- Implement clean program exit on user actions.

**Tasks:**
1. Implement user interface features for window management.
2. Define interactions such as ESC key and window close actions.
3. Test and refine user interface elements.

### **Sprint 6: Testing and Optimization**
**Goals:**
- Conduct comprehensive testing of the entire program.
- Identify and fix bugs or errors.
- Optimize the code for performance.

**Tasks:**
1. Create a test suite covering various scenarios.
2. Conduct functional and integration testing.
3. Address identified bugs and errors.
4. Optimize code for better performance.

### **Sprint 7: Documentation and Finalization**
**Goals:**
- Document the code and usage of the program.
- Finalize the project for submission.
- Prepare for the defense with a set of scenes.

**Tasks:**
1. Generate comprehensive documentation for the code.
2. Perform final testing and validation.
3. Prepare a set of scenes for the defense.
4. Package the project for submission.

### **Review and Retrospective:**
- Conduct a review of the project's functionality against the initial requirements.
- Collect feedback from the team and make improvements for future iterations.

### **Note:**
- The above sprints are flexible, and adjustments can be made based on feedback and progress.
- Regular sprint reviews and retrospectives will guide future iterations and improvements.
- Continuous communication and collaboration among team members are essential for successful agile development.
